**When to Use MTurk vs Other Workforces:** `#exam-tip`

| Use Case | Workforce Choice |
|----------|------------------|
| Public data, low sensitivity | Mechanical Turk (cheapest, fastest) |
| Confidential/proprietary data | Private workforce (your employees) |
| Need domain expertise | Vendor workforce (managed experts) |
| High volume, simple tasks | Mechanical Turk |
| Complex tasks requiring training | Private or vendor workforce |
| HIPAA/PII data | Private workforce (NOT MTurk) `#gotcha` |

**Exam Tips:** `#exam-tip`
- **MTurk = public workforce** - Don't use for sensitive/confidential data
- **Ground Truth uses MTurk** by default but also supports private workforces
- **A2I workforce options:** MTurk (public), Private (your team), Vendor (managed)
- **Cost:** MTurk cheapest, Vendor most expensive
- **Quality control:** Use consensus (multiple workers), qualifications, gold standards
- **Not for sensitive data:** PHI, PII, trade secrets â†’ use private workforce `#gotcha`

**Quality Control Strategies:**
1. **Consensus** - Multiple workers label same item, use majority vote
2. **Qualifications** - Require workers to pass tests
3. **Master workers** - Pre-vetted high-quality workers (premium)
4. **Gold standard data** - Hidden test items with known answers
5. **Worker ratings** - Track and filter by accuracy

**Pricing Model:**
- Pay per completed task (HIT)
- Set your own price per task
- MTurk takes 20% fee (40% for 10+ workers per task)
- Example: $0.10/task, 1000 tasks = $120 total cost ($100 + $20 fee)
